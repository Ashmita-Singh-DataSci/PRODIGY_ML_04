# Hand Signs Recognition 

This is my 4th task for ProdigyInfotech, where I make a 
CNN model for hand signs recognition, which have a 
lot of applications in our modern world. 

One strong realization I got from this that, reall more the 
data, more the accuracy. No matter how similar the data looks.
